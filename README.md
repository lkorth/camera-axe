The Camera Axe is a professional triggering system for photographers. It has a very flexible sensor
architecture that lets the user easily pick how and when they want to trigger their camera or flash.
A few of its most common use cases are water droplet photography, bullet photography, explosion
photography, and wildlife photography.
